                <h3>HOME</h3>
                <h4>This year I learned how to make websites as you may be able to tell. This has been one of my favorite classes this semester. Im glad that we were to figure things out by taling with eachother and learning instead of being told how to fix it. If i had to choose a flaw, it would be that there were several things that we had to remember all the basic things for bootstrap, and Css although we were allowed to look them up that would be the one flaw</h4>

                <h3>3D models</h3>
                <p>My favorite 3D modeling was maybe my teddybear and the coffee cup, sorry Mr. Ryan you are finding out about this now but I cheated I angled it to make it look like the handle wasnt a torus or whatever you told us not to use.
